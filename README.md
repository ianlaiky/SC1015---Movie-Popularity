COVID-19 has cause significant impact to our society for the past 2-3 years, this is especially true for the film
industry. Cinemas were closed to prevent the spread of the virus and today requires patrons to leave gaps between each
other thus reducing the potential earnings for a particular screening. <br><br>
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) focuses how movie producers can
maximise their profit.

## Problem Definition

* How do different variables affect the revenue of a movie?

## Models Used

* Random Forest
* Multivariate Linear Regression
* XGBoost

## Conclusion

### Data-driven insights and recommendations:

* July as a release month brings in high revenue.

* Including elements of action, adventure, history, fantasy in the story of the movie will be beneficial as those genres
  have shown to generate high revenues.

* Keeping the runtime within a 50-150 minutes range, is optimal in ensuring high revenues.

* Popularity has a moderately strong correlation with revenue, therefore, movie producers should make an effort to
  market their movie well so that its popularity is high.

* Including actors with a consistently successful work performance in the movie may enhance the chances of generating a
  higher revenue.

### Project Outcomes and Conclusions:

* Predict revenue of a movie based on factors during the making of the movie.

* Random forest and Multivariate linear regression did give most similar accuracy, however linear regression accuracy
  was most similar in train and test.

## Project Takeaway

### What did we learn?

* Random Forest Regression
* XGBoost
